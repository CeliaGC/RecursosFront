FrontEnd resources for bootcamp coders

This is a repository nesting several repositories as a resource for MÃ©rida Coders students so they can clone from once all those exercises, example projects and other files an documents we have been working in frontend from the beginning of the bootcamp.
The stack will include by the end: HTML, CSS, JS, DOM, REACT, Json Server, NodeJS, JQuery, Typescript, Jest.
As next steps, there is an idea of gathering some of the "katas" in a Single Page Application 'Merida-games' built up with react, with fake api storage and plenty of Jest tests.

There is four branches, each one corresponds to a new stage in the development of the mentioned Merida-games app. Consult itw own Readme for further information
