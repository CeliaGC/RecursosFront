# GitWorkshop
This repository is the result of a  gitflow workshop we had at MÃ©rida Coders bootcamp, so the students got familiar with pull-merge-solve conflicts-push rituals.
Each coder created a local branch from main and wrote three milestones in their lives. Then they got to merge each branch into dev without "eating" their mates changes. Finally of course, we merged dev into main. Such a nice day!
